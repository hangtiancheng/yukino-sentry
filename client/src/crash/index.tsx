/**
 * Seed for EventType.React: a component that randomly throws during render.
 *
 * React render errors are NOT visible to the global `window "error"` listener
 * in a useful way — they must be caught by an error boundary. The SDK ships
 * <ReactErrorBoundary>, whose componentDidCatch forwards the error, its stack
 * and React's component-stack info as an EventType.React report.
 *
 * Mechanics:
 *   1. Every ROLL_INTERVAL_MS a probability roll may flip `shouldCrash` on.
 *   2. <CrashingProbe> then throws synchronously during render.
 *   3. The surrounding <ReactErrorBoundary> catches + reports the error and
 *      renders an invisible fallback, so the host app is never disturbed.
 *   4. One second later the boundary is remounted via a changing `key`
 *      (class-based boundaries keep their error state until remount) and the
 *      probe returns to its harmless state, ready for the next roll.
