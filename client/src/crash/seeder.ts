/**
 * Error seeder: plants probabilistic, randomly-triggered errors so that every
 * error category collectible by @yukino.js/sentry shows up in real report
 * traffic. Each seed rolls its own independent probability on a fixed timer
 * tick, so over time all error types appear with different frequencies.
 *
 * Covered @yukino.js/sentry event types:
 *   - EventType.Error (uncaught runtime errors: TypeError / ReferenceError,
 *     reported through the global `window "error"` listener with
 *     line/column info, so they are sourcemap-resolvable on the server)
 *   - EventType.Error via the decorated `console.error` (SDK intercepts
 *     Error objects passed to console.error)
 *   - EventType.UnhandledRejection (promise rejected without a .catch handler)
 *   - EventType.Resource (an <img> element whose src returns 404)
 *   - EventType.Fetch (HTTP 4xx response captured by the fetch decoration)
 *   - EventType.Fetch with statusCode 0 (network-level fetch failure)
 *   - EventType.Xhr (HTTP 4xx response captured by the XMLHttpRequest
 *     decoration; the app itself only uses fetch, so this seed keeps the
 *     XHR capture path exercised)
 *   - EventType.Error via the manual traceError() API
 *   - Batch error aggregation (>= 5 errors sharing the same
 *     type-name-message within a 2s window collapse into one batch report)
 *
 * The React render error (EventType.React) is seeded separately by the
 * <RandomCrash /> component, see ./index.tsx.
