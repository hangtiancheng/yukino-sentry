 * Shared ExposurePlugin instance + React hook. The plugin only reports when
 * elements are observed, so dashboard cards opt in via useExposure(); an
 * Exposure event fires each time an observed card scrolls out of the viewport.
 *
 * Implemented as a callback ref (not useRef + effect) so observation follows
 * conditional rendering: cards mounted after the empty/loading state are still
 * observed, and unmounted cards are released.
