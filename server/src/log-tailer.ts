/**
 * Incremental (tail -f style) parser for the ONE jsonl file the logger is
 * currently appending to. Rotated files are immutable and served from the
 * yukino-cache group in log-reader; re-parsing the growing active file on
 * every dashboard poll is what this class eliminates: each poll only reads
 * and parses the bytes appended since the previous poll.
 *
 * Correctness notes:
 * - jsonl is append-only, so parsed state stays valid while size grows.
 * - A size DECREASE means truncation/replacement; state is rebuilt from 0.
 * - The trailing bytes after the last "\n" (a batch still being written) are
 *   kept as a raw Buffer remainder and re-joined with the next chunk, so a
 *   UTF-8 code point split across two reads decodes correctly and a partial
 *   line is never counted twice.
 * - Parsed events for the active file are held in memory until rotation
 *   adopts the next file; the file-size rotation limit (log.max_size) bounds
 *   this state.
